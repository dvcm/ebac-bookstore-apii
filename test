I have dockerized a django project and it runs on my local mashine with $dcoker run ,i uploaded the project on heroku and run bellow commands :

$ heroku container:login
$ heroku container:push web
$ heroku container:release web
so when i opened the address https://docker-on-test.herokuapp.com/ on browser i got the Application error and after heroku logs --tail i realized this is the error i have :

=== Fetching app code

    ADD . /code/
    RUN python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    RUN pip3 install -r requiremenrs.txt
    RUN python manage.py migrate
    CMD ["python3","manage.py", "runserver","0.0.0.0:8000"]
docker-compose.yml :

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: bash -c "python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
    container_name: code
    volumes:
      - .:/code
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
and heroku.yml :
